# 2D_Game - Episode Eight

In this episode, I used an image of a 'level' to create the bare bones of a level one for the game. There is now a beginner background in the game window.

I also recaluclated the size of the window based on the size of tiles within a level, to ensure the sprite and level are in the correct proportions to the window.
