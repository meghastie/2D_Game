# 2D_Game

My first ever game project - a 2D platformer game. To create this game, I used the online tutorial by Kaarin Gaming. 

I decided to follow this tutorial to enhance my overall Java skills and knowledge of the Java swing library, and get used to developing an interactive user interface. As of now, the game is a work in progress, and I plan to finish it and create my own levels / personal tweaks, then hopefully start developing my own game projects.

Each branch is a seperate episode of the tutorial. The code contains a series of comments for my own understanding and learning.
