# 2D_Game - episode 22

In this episode I added the base code for porjectiles and created our first one - cannon balls. When the player is in the line of sight of the cannon, It will fire a cannon ball, which will inflict damage on the player. Cannon balls will continue until they hit a wall to which they will dissapear.
