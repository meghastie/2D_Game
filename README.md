# 2D_Game - episode 19

The game now has objects - 2 typos of potions, barrels and boxes:
* The red potion will increase a players health by 15, as represented on the players health bar. If the player is at max health, it will have no effect.
* The blue potion will increase a players 'power' by 10 - functionality to come
* By attacking boxes and barrels, the player can break them open. Upon breaking them, the player will get a potion.
* potions are constantly animating, however boxes and barrells will only animate when being broken.
