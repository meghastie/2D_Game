# 2D_Game - episode 26

In this episode, I added a power attack. The player has a power bar which will grow over time. The player can also pick up blue potions, which will add 10 to their current power level. Power attacks will kill all enemies/break all objects in their path. To execute a power attack, press the backspace key.
